WORK IN PROGRESS!

This exercise requires implementation of the simulated annealing algorithm in a Jupyter notebook. The algorithm is then used to solve a sample Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).

To launch the notebook, run the following command from a terminal with anaconda3 installed and on the application path:

    jupyter notebook AIND-Simulated_Annealing.ipynb
